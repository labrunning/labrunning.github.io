      <description>Waking up this morning, thinking about the difference between &amp;ldquo;Can I have&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Can I get&amp;rdquo; I wondered whether the perceived Americanism of &amp;ldquo;Can I get&amp;rdquo; was actually ruder than &amp;ldquo;Can I have&amp;rdquo;. Looking at several sites only showed me the rich diversity of the English language and that there were just as many Americans who thought &amp;ldquo;Can I get&amp;rdquo; would be rude as there were those who thought it was perfectly fine.</description>

      <description>I got an email from BT who provide my phone and internet about renewing my contract. Now currently my phone isn&amp;apos;t even plugged in, but that&amp;apos;s another story, so I don&amp;apos;t really like having to pay line rental as it is but it seems to be perfectly legal for companies to bundle this in as a requirement. They were asking if I wanted to renew my contract with them, with what initially seemed a worse deal for the same price.</description>
