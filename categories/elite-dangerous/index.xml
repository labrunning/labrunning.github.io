      <description>Despite not even being able to play the game Elite Dangerous I find myself preoccupied thinking and discussing it on the internet, primarily in the official Frontier Forums. The word &amp;lsquo;griefing&amp;rsquo; is bandied around a lot by people there and like many words it means different things to different people. I looked to Wikipedia for a definition, but it was a little vague for me. I read the paper which was referenced in the article and being an academic paper it was a little more detailed and I now accept this definition as my working one;</description>

      <description>After wondering how Frontier&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;disconcertingly vague&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Nothing to announce at this time&amp;rdquo; actually pan out over time I thought I would make a note of their current FAQs for PS4 here and keep an eye on developments after it was announced on several websites today that there would be a physical disc copy of ED released for PS4 and XBox One. The update date below is Frontier&amp;rsquo;s, not mine.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tremendously excited by Elite Dangerous making an appearance on Playstation 4. I spent many happy hours as a child playing the original Elite on my Acorn Electron in the 80s. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what rank I managed to get up to but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t Elite. The originality and advanced nature is a matter of record now but what really hooked me was that ever since seeing Star Wars at the age of four I had spent most of my formative years wishing to be whisked away into space on a spaceship.</description>
