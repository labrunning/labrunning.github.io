      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tremendously excited by Elite Dangerous making an appearance on Playstation 4. I spent many happy hours as a child playing the original Elite on my Acorn Electron in the 80s. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what rank I managed to get up to but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t Elite. The originality and advanced nature is a matter of record now but what really hooked me was that ever since seeing Star Wars at the age of four I had spent most of my formative years wishing to be whisked away into space on a spaceship.</description>
