          <p>I got an email from BT who provide my phone and internet about renewing my contract. Now currently my phone isn&apos;t even plugged in, but that&apos;s another story, so I don&apos;t really like having to pay line rental as it is but it seems to be perfectly legal for companies to bundle this in as a requirement. They were asking if I wanted to renew my contract with them, with what initially seemed a worse deal for the same price. I actually took screenshots of the link because I thought the poor person I would end up talking to would be oblivious to this mistake. By the time I actually investigated my contract end date (via a charming lady with a very Indian name who I won&apos;t make any presumptions about where she actually worked) they had corrected this mistake, but sure enough after being a loyal customer for 12 months I was being offered the princely reduction of &hellip; &pound;0.00.</p>

<p>Maybe BT weren&apos;t aware they had competitors. Maybe they weren&apos;t aware that those competitors have price reductions for new customers. Maybe they were counting on me being extremely lazy/wealthy/stupid/all of the above. Fortunately for me only (A) applied, and I was able to search for a better deal from the comfort of my sofa. Which isn&apos;t actually that comfy at the moment, but again I digress. I wasn&apos;t going to Sky after I had left them some years ago and have no desire to pay a fortune for things I never watch. I wasn&apos;t going anywhere near Talk Talk as I have only heard complaints about them and nothing positive at all. However I had heard good things about <a href="http://www.plus.net">PlusNet</a> who did fibre. I had fibre with BT being one of the lucky people who can get this service and wasn&apos;t about to give it up with a household rammed full of online gadgets. I checked out the PlusNet cost in a trusty old <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/numbers/">Numbers</a> spreadsheet and found that I could save just over &pound;16 a month by switching to PlusNet. For the first six months I also got an extra &pound;11 per month off. The only downside is that from what I could tell from online reviews is that the router wasn&apos;t great; well with the initial six month saving I could easily get a better router, and one that supports <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">DD-WRT</a> which I had always wanted to try out anyway. So, I signed up to PlusNet and asked BT for a <a href="http://www.maccode.org.uk">MAC code</a>. I got an email from BT, which I will quote below;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&apos;ve looked at your BT account and I can see that youre a loyal and longstanding BT customer and wed really like you to stay with us.</p>

<p>For this reason I can reduce your broadband package price from £27.67 per month down to £19.65 per month. This is a fantastic saving of £96.24 over the next 12 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well why on earth wasn&apos;t I offered this in the first place? By trying to save £96.24 in that first instance, it has ended up costing BT £427.68 for the year in lost business. I can only presume that someone has crunched the numbers on renewals and retentions and that I&apos;m in the moinority. I&apos;ve always been happy with the BT Service and had no problems at all with my internet and I may rue switching but the PlusNet contract is 18 months after which of course as a new customer I&apos;ll be welcomed back with all the <a href="http://www.bt.com/packages">latest deals</a>&hellip;</p>
